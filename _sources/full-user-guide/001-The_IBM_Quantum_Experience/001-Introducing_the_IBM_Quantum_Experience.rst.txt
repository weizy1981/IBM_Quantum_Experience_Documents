| Quantum computing is here. While today's quantum processors are modest
  in size, the complexity grows continuously. The time is ripe to build
  and engage a community of new quantum learners, so that we change the
  way we think about computing.  Our goal with the IBM Quantum
  Experience is for you to learn about the quantum world by reading this
  User Guide, composing your own experiments, running them in
  simulation, and executing them on the world’s first fully-controllable
  quantum processor through the IBM Cloud.

The IBM Quantum Experience consists of:

-  a set of tutorials (this User Guide) that will lead you from the
   basics of simple single-qubit experiments (`Section
   II </qstage/#/tutorial?sectionId=71972f437b08e12d1f465a8857f4514c>`__)
   to more complicated multi-qubit experiments (`Section
   III </qstage/#/tutorial?sectionId=050edf961d485bfcd9962933ea09062b>`__),
   and then toward more advanced ideas in the area of quantum algorithms
   (`Section IV </qstage/#/tutorial?sectionId=8443c4f713521c10b1a56a533958286b>`__)
   and quantum error correction (`Section V </qstage/#/tutorial?sectionId=bfd2a30ad6c5c915da3a696d76c474d7>`__);
-  the **Quantum Composer,** which is a graphical user interface where
   you can create your very own quantum circuit (which we call a
   **quantum score),** much like a composer composes a music score;
-  a simulator that can test your quantum scores;
-  access to an actual quantum processor running in an IBM Quantum
   Computing lab, where your quantum scores will be executed; and
-  a **quantum community** where your quantum scores, ideas, and
   experiences can be shared and discussed.

Please note that the IBM Quantum Experience is a "living experiment,"
and we are constantly making updates to it.  We hope our users will help
us refine its functionality and improve the overall interface by
providing feedback. In the community forum, please let us know your
thoughts for improvement -- and please share any cool scores and results
you come across!  If you find any bugs, please report them with our bug
tracker, accessible via the little bug icon in the lower right-hand
corner of each page.

To make sure everyone has a chance to use the real device in our lab via
the Cloud, we have established a **Units** currency system. If you have
joined the IBM Quantum Experience as a **Standard User,** you have full
access to our simulation capabilities and to previously-run cached
results from the real device and a small number of Units to run
real experiments on the quantum processor hardware. Once you have read
through the User Guide you will be rewarded with extra Units to run more
real-time experiments. This system allows our experiment queue to run
smoothly. When your Units are used up, you will be replenished once you
have viewed the results of the completed execution. We also invite
Standard Users to request an upgrade of your User status to \ **Expert
User**\ , which provides access to more Units and other advanced
features as we introduce them. Contact us and let us know why you would
like to become an Expert User. 

The quantum processor in our lab requires frequent calibration; during
these short periods, you will receive a "Down for Calibration" notice
and if we need to perform maintenance a "Down for Maintenance" message
will be displayed. In both cases the simulation will be available for
you to keep learning and designing new experiments. 

For those who wish to jump right into creating your own experiments, you
can skip right to the \ `Quantum Composer </qstage/#/tutorial?sectionId=75a85f7e14ae3fd4329ad5c3e59466ea&pageIndex=3>`__\ .
If you wish to improve your understanding of the quantum world first,
please continue reading this User Guide, starting with \ `the Quantum World </qstage/#/tutorial?sectionId=75a85f7e14ae3fd4329ad5c3e59466ea&pageIndex=1>`__\ 
section on the next page.  Use the numbers at the top and bottom of each
page to navigate through each section. 

| Prepare yourself for a wild and fascinating journey -- and it all
  starts with a qubit.

We would like to acknowledge the work done under the IARPA Multi-Qubit
Coherent Operations program, the Logical Qubits program, the LPS Quantum
Characterization Validation & Verification program, and the IBM Research
Frontiers Institute. The research performed in those programs has
contributed to making this Quantum Experience possible. 

Thank you,

Jay Gambetta, Jerry Chow, and the IBM Quantum team
